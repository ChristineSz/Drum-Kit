# Drum-Kit

What have I learned :

- -To use Higher Order Function -the function thats eable to take functions as input

    -created the addEventListener() function as a Higher Order Function 
    
    -as he takes the respondToKey() function as an input

- -To use Callback Function -a function that gets past in as an input (alows us to wait to somhing to finish, to happening.

    -in our code waiting for a click event and then the callback function gets called back and executed.

- -To use Debugging -use the debugger keyword to debugg the code-to see how the code works behind the scene
